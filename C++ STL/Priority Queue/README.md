# Priority Queue

In this data structure a queue is maintained in order of the element's priority.<br>
Whatever element is greater comes at the top.<br>
Main functions:<br>
* push
* pop
* top
<br><br>
If we want max element at top then the priority queue is called **Max Heap**.<br>
If we want min element at top then the priority queue is called **Min Heap**.

### Time Complexity

* push - log n
* pop - log n
* top - O(1)
