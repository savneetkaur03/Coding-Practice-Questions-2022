# Map

Map is a data structure which can store diffenent elements if they are same like 1 1 etc.
<br>
It has a unique key with the help of which it can store same elements multiple times.
<br>
Stores in sorted order and stores unique key. Thus, it is somewhat similar to set.
<br>
It stores keys and value of that keys.

## Complexity
log n

<br><br>

# Multimap

It is similar to map but now we can have multiple keys.<br>
Now we can also store like:<br>
{1,2},{1,3}<br>
In a sorted order as well.

# Unordered Map

It has unique key but not store in sorted order.

## Complexity
O(1)
<br>
But in worst case i.e, one in blue moon, O(N).
